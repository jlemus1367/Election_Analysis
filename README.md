# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
The Colorado Board of Elections has given us the task to determine the results of an election for a particular congressional district. They have provided us with a CSV file that contains all the votes cast for the congressional district in question. Using the file, we must substantiate the winner of the election and other data of interest that could help determine the future outcome of other elections. We will be using python and the CSV module to aid in our election audit. Considering that we are working with an entire congressional district's election data, we can expect a sizeable data set that is too large to be analyzed with excel or other spreadsheet applications. It is imperative that we convey the information to the board of elections promptly to ensure a smooth transition of power. Python and its extensive resources will provide us the processing power to generate the data we are seeking.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.54.3
